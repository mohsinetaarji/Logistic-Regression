For this assignment, you are asked to implement the logistic regression algorithm for classifying data. The implementation will be done in two different ways: First, you will use the Scikit-Learn library to classify the data, then you will use your own Python implementation of the algorithm to classify the same data a second time.  
  
  Output:
-	Print the W vector for each of the three classes
-	While computing the W vector for each class, show a plot of the cost as a function of the number of iterations.
-	Show the accuracy in the predictions for each of the three binary classifiers.
-	Show the accuracy of the overall model, in predicting the testing dataset.
