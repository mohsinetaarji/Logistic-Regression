# Logistique-Regression

For this assignment, you are asked to implement the logistic regression algorithm for classifying data. The implementation will be done in two different ways: First, you will use the Scikit-Learn library to classify the data, then you will use your own Python implementation of the algorithm to classify the same data a second time.
